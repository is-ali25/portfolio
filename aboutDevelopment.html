            This project was for an assignment in my User Interfaces course, and had to include filters, sorting, and some way to accumulate the data selected by users.
            Super Smash Brothers is my favorite game and is the most popular fighting game in the world. As great as it is, however, its 80+ character roster can be overwhelming, 
            especially for new players. I made this site as a way to help players figure out who they should play, and also as an entry point for players to explore how different characters
            were designed to be played.
